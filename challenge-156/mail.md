## Intro

Dear Sir, it's an honor for me to be part of the team, I would like to join theweeklychallenge for the following reasons

1. Improve my problem solving skills.
2. To master perl and raku.
3. To learn from Senoirs.

## About me

My name is KUEPPO Wesley living in Africa/Cameroon/Yaounde, I'm 20 yrs/old, the first born out of 7.

I'm a student at the university of yaounde I, level 3, preparing for my bachelor's degree in computer science. I started Computer
science in 2019, back then I never really knew what it was, I only master C, Bash, and awk. I barely scratched the surface
of the python, javascript and C++, I learnt them just for school stuffs and I fell in love with perl some months ago.

My choosen fields are Operating systems and Computer Network.

I'm living in anguish, the reason why I'm so slow but by the end of this academic year, I have as objective to master
the delevopement of web back-end systems (in perl and javascript) and Devops operations so that at the end I might be
able to get a job from perljobs.

My parents are planning to move me to Belgium so I can have more opportinuties and support them.

Perl Projects I'm currently working on are

1. paranoid, an ncurses based system resource monitoring tool.
2. krit, a HEAD/GET/POST/PUT/DELETE web server.
3. My blog (with Mojo).

Perl, Raku and AWK are my programming languages of interest in solving the weekly chanllenge
but apart from that I'm also fully interested in posix sh, C, Rust, Lua, Javascript, and Typescript.

I'm hoping to learn a lot from the Team, thanks :).
